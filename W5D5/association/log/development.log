DEPRECATION WARNING: Passing a class to the `class_name` is deprecated and will raise an ArgumentError in Rails 5.2. It eagerloads more classes than necessary and potentially creates circular dependencies. Please pass the class name as a string: `belongs_to :instructor, class_name: 'User'` (called from <class:Course> at /Users/appacademy/Downloads/W5D5/association/app/models/course.rb:17)
